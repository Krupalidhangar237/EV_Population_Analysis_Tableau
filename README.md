# ⚡Electric Vehicle Population Data Analysis (USA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end **Visual Analytics solution** to analyze the growth, distribution, and adoption trends of **Electric Vehicles (EVs)** across the United States. Using **Tableau**, the project transforms raw EV registration data into interactive dashboards that reveal key insights for policymakers, businesses, and researchers.

The analysis highlights state-wise EV adoption, manufacturer dominance, vehicle type comparison (BEV vs PHEV), and year-wise growth trends using intuitive visual storytelling.
